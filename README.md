# 2015 PyMNtos

Converging on the topic of vulnerability, this talk explores iterative
design. We will walk through using Pandas, R and D3 inside IPython Notebook.  

Many thanks to [@MonteLunacek](https://twitter.com/montelunacek?lang=en) for
hacking together a solution to access the d3 library within IPython!
